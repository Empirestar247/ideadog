## Description :bulb:

IdeaDog is a social web application for sharing ideas. Why statically-typed, you ask?
Well, the front-end of the application is built in React, with TypeScript, while the back-end runs on Rust. TypeScript + Rust = The Ultimate Statically-Typed Web App!

Development of IdeaDog has only just begun. Stay tuned, there is much, much, much more to come!
